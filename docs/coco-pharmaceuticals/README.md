# Introducing Coco Pharmaceuticals

Coco Pharmaceuticals (CocoP) is a fictitious organization that is used by
the Egeria team to illustrate different open metadata and governance scenarios.

This company is vertical integrated, with its own research, manufacturing,
sales and distribution services.
Its business model is focus on supplying unique targeted medication for
cancer suffers. 
In recent years, their focus has been in personalised
medicine - where a patient's genome is used to determine the right course
of treatment.  This has created a massive growth in the
amount and the sensitivity of the data they hold.

Coco Pharmaceuticals has research partnerships with universities in
order to collaborate on further research.

## History

The company has grown from a small group of researchers working
together in a spirit of open communication, collaboration and trust
to a medium-sized successful pharmaceutical company that has a small
range of very successful drugs in the market and many others in
development – three of which look very promising.

Their investment in IT had traditionally been focused on the
automation of the manufacturing process due to the growth in demand
for their most successful drugs.  However, a recent attempted fraud in their
supplier network sparked a company-wide investigation into
their operations.  The result was the appointment of Jules Keeper as their
Chief Data Officer (CDO).  Jules' mission is to improve the organization's
protection, management and use of data.

Jules instigated a company-wide data strategy focused on "better data
for everyone".  This was underpinned by an data governance program
that ensured their regulatory compliance as well as providing for data
management, protection and access.

Through Jules' influence:
* Faith Broker, their HR director, was also appointed as their Privacy Officer.
* Ivor Padlock, their security officer was teamed up with Gary Geeke,
their IT infrastructure expert to be responsible for cyber security.
* Erin Overview, their IT Architect, was given greater prominence in the
organization since her deep expertise is in information architecture.
She was able then to get some investment in master data management,
a data lake for the researchers and metadata management tools.
* Individuals throughout the business were appointed as data owners.
For example, Tom Tally from Finance was appointed
the data owner of the accounts data, and Tessa Tube, a Lead Researcher,
became the data owner for their clinical research data.
* Jules also appointed data stewards for critical data sets.
Tanya Tidie, their clinical records clark, became a data steward for
all patient records maintained during clinical trials.
