![Icon](erin-overview.png)

Age: 42

Skills: solution and information architecture, information modeling

Scope: Organization-wide

Job:
* Erin is an information architect. She supports requests for data
from different parts of the business.
* Since [Jules Keeper](jules-keeper.md), The Chief Data Officer
joined, Erin's role has evolved to include a more
strategic look at the information provision at
Coco Pharmaceuticals.
* She is now responsible for setting the
IT standards and architecture that support the policies laid down by
[Jules](jules-keeper.md).
Her standards are used in the development of new systems and in the
integration of external systems. 
* Erin also focuses on the optimization and integrity of the information
supply chains that synchronize information between the IT systems.

Thinks/Feels:
* Overwhelmed by the constant requests for data.
* Unappreciated by the business.
* Hopeful that things will improve now Jules has joined.

Hears:
* Criticism of the IT team for being unresponsive to the needs of the business.

Says/Does:
* Responds to data requests as fast as possible.
* Is constantly explaining why it takes so much work to retrieve data
on an ad hoc basis from the existing systems.

Sees:
* The requests for data increasing and she is not sure how much more she can do.

Top challenges:
* So many systems, each with their own data and no easy way to manage complexity.
* Constant demand for data extracts from the business teams.
* New software packages being deployed with no thought for
how the data within it will be supported.
* No budget to increase the size of her team – nor
automate some of the common requests.

Desired Outcome:
* A catalog of data sources and a way to measure and monitor
their quality and how the information is flowing between them.
* An easy way to communicate with the developers and
business about their responsibilities around data.
* Some way of making common requests for data repeatable and self-service.
* Appreciation for her teams efforts.
