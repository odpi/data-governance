![Icon](sidney-seeker.png)

Age: 49

Skills: financial management, legal procedures.

Scope: Fraud Investigation – particularly forensic audit

Job:
* Sidney is an expert in anti-fraud procedures and investigation.
He used to work for the police force, but now is a private contractor
working with different clients on their fraud detection
and prevention procedures.
* He has been working with this company for about six months
advising them on anti-fraud monitoring approaches when a set
of unexplained payments are detected and he is pulled in to
help with the investigation.

Thinks/Feels:
* Sidney understands the hurt and concern that [Reggie](reggie-mint.md)
has over the suspected fraudulent activity but feels that the
company is partly to blame because their lack of control of
information has made them an easy target.

Hears:
* Hurt, concern and disbelief that the company seems to have
been targeted by fraudsters.

Says/Does:
* Sidney helps Reggie plan an orderly investigation of their
supply chain to understand the extend of the problem,
locate the perpetrators and remedy any impact on legitimate
suppliers and customers.

Sees:
* The finance team having to use spreadsheets to supplement
the data from IT for all but the most routine of decisions and reporting.
This is going to make the investigation more complicated
as some of the key data is ungoverned.

Top challenges:
* Sidney needs to help the company tighten up their procedures to
make it harder for the company to be exploited by fraudsters
whilst still preserving the collaborative, open culture that
has created their innovative range of products.

Desired Outcome:
* The fraud investigation successfully removes this incident
of fraudulent activity.
* The company learns from this and puts in place proper anti-fraud procedures.
