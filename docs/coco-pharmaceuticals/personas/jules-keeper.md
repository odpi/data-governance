Job:
* As a newly appointed CDO, Jules is responsible for leading the
business transformation that brings data, and data driven decisions
to the heart of the business.

* Too many spreadsheets used for decision making that contain
data of dubious origin, accuracy and completeness.

for the accuracy of data and the proper use of information within
the business teams.  This is no longer an “IT problem”.

possible whilst still enabling flexibility in the use of information.
