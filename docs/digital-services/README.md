# Digital Services

A **digital service** is an automated service delivered via the Internet or private network.

Typically it has a well-defined interface for requesting actions and data.
This interface may include one, or a combination of the following:
* A user interface, such as a browser, application (eg Mobile App), or specialized device that allows
a person to interact with the service.  
* An API that is accessed by another digital service.
* An output feed of data that other digital services can subscribe to to receive a copy of this data
* An input feed of data or requests for the digital service to process.

As part of its operation, a digital service will exchange data with its callers.
It may also store data and share it with third parties.
A digital service may also call other digital services to provide part of its function.

Organizations today increasingly rely on digital services to transact their business,
with their customers, employees and business partners.
The result is that data is being generated and exchanged in a complex network of digital services that belong to
different organizations.

Privacy regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation require an organization to guarantee that they are only
processing personal data with the consent of the **[data subject](../roles/data-subject-role.md)**.
This means an organization needs to understand
and manage the personal data consumed by their digital services.
