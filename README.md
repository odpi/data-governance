# data-governance
The ODPi Data Governance Project develops collateral to encourage adoption of the open metadata and governance standards.  
These standards are provided through the [ODPi Egeria](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) open source project.
ODPi Egeria provides the reference implementation of these standards that are packaged into reusable libraries for vendors to include.  

This GitHub site is used for developing collateral.  To see our latest completed material, see [Data Governance Best Practices](https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/).
