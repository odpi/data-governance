# ODPi Data Governance Initiative (data-governance)

The ODPi Data Governance Initiative aims to build valuable packages that install into the open metadata and governance capability provided through Apache Atlas.  (See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ATLAS/Open+Metadata+and+Governance).

The aim of each package is to accelerate your organization's data governance initiatives by providing metadata content, APIs and UIs that target a specific industry need or regulation.  The content can then be customized for your organization once it is installed.

The first package will be on data privacy.
